🔐 AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System


📌 Overview

This project implements an AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Machine Learning (Random Forest) and deploys it as an interactive Streamlit web application.
The system is designed to detect malicious network traffic, highlight the most influential features used for detection, and provide real-time analysis through a clean, user-friendly interface.

The project is suitable for cybersecurity demonstrations, academic projects, and internship evaluations.
